Patch Notes (11/27/2019):

New Features:

-Toggling off labels for /showplot for Radar Plots now displays a GIF of each person on the plot.
    * To use this, just do /showplot [ID] 0
-Changed /radarplotme to /plotmeradar to be consistent. The simple alias is now /pmr.
-Added /plotcrowdsource and /crowdsourceconsent for crowdsource plotting.
    * You have to give your consent to be crowdsourced on each plot: /cc [plot_id]
    * You must then plot yourself as an initial point somewhere on the plot.
    * Others can then /pc [plot_id] [name] [values] to contribute!
    * Note: For now, remove any spaces from the name.
    * You can remove your consent by using /cc [plot_id] again.

Bug Fixes:

-Fixed a bug where Radar Plot labels couldn't have spaces.
-Fixed a bug where /pmr broke entirely.
