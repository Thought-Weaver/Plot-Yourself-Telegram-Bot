Patch Notes (11/7/2019):

New Features:

-/help now sends the help information by direct message from the bot.
-Added /archive and /unarchive for archiving and unarchiving plots. Archived plots do not appear in /listplots.
-/plotme and /removeme now auto-select the most recent plot if a plot ID is not specified.
-Regular plots will no longer display anything past their bounds.
-Added /fulllistplots (/flp) to display a full list of plots, both archived and unarchived.
-Added /myplots to send you a list of plots you've made.
-Added /start as an initial startup helper for the bot! Think of it like a mini /help.

Bug Fixes:

-Fixed a bug where the last person who bet the same value would win, rather than the first.
-Fixed a bug where /currentbet wouldn't send a message if no one had bet.
-Fixed a bug where /completebet wouldn't check to see if anyone had actually bet yet.
-Fixed a bug where you could override plots by creating new ones if one had been deleted.
