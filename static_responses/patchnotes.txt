Patch Notes (11/23/2019):

New Features:

-Added /radarplot for making radar plots.
    * Radar plots are quite unique. You can enter as many labels as you want:
    * /radp -t Title -l label1 -l label2 -l label3 ...
-Radar plots require you to use /rpm instead of /pm and cannot determine the last plot automatically.
    * /rpm starts right of the numbers and moves clockwise.
-Normalized axis label and title sizes.
-/listplots and /fulllistplots are now sent to your DMs! Make sure to DM the bot.
-Added alerts when using commands requiring DMs, but you haven't DMed the bot.

Bug Fixes:

-Fixed message when creating an empty plot.
-Fixed /whosplotted and /lookup for Radar Plots.
-Repositioned Radar Plot legend to avoid cutoff.
