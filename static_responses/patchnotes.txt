Patch Notes (11/1/2019):

New Features:

-Added /lookup {plot_id} {name} to find where someone is on a plot.
-Added a betting system for correlation values!
    * /setupbet {plot_id} {degree} will begin a bet for that plot on a polynomial of that degree.
    * /bet {r^2 value} will place your bet into the lot. You can change this before the bet closes.
    * /completebet will determine the winner and close the bet.
    * /cancelbet will end the current bet.
    * Only one bet can exist at a time.
    * Your reward is personal pride and possibly the beginning of a gambling addiction.
-Added an optional param to polyfit and showplot for toggling labels:
    * /showplot 13 0 will show plot 13 without labels.
    * /showplot 13 1 will show plot 13 with labels.
    * /showplot 13 will show plot 13 with labels.
    * /pp 13 will display a linear fit for plot 13.
    * /pp 13 2 will display a quadratic fit for plot 13.
    * /pp 13 2 0 will display a quadratic fit without labels for plot 13.
-Improved performance of generating polyfits.
-Updated error messages for more clarity.

Bug Fixes:

-Plot will now re-display after removing yourself from the plot.
