Patch Notes (11/23/2019):

New Features:

-Added /radarplot for making radar plots.
    * Radar plots are quite unique. You can enter as many labels as you want:
    * /radp -t Title -l label1 -l label2 -l label3 ...
-Radar plots require you to use /rpm instead of /pm and cannot determine the last plot automatically.
-Normalized axis label and title sizes.

Bug Fixes:

-Fixed message when creating an empty plot.
